# Arxiv-physics-articles-classification

## Problem background
The physics articles on the Arxiv website are divided into several subfields, here I try to use the abstract of each article to predict which subfield it belongs to.

## Data description
Seven subfields are included in this task:
```
Astrophysics
Condensed Matter
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology
High Energy Physics
Mathematical Physics
Quantum Physics
Nuclear Experiment
```
24 articles are randomly selected for each subfield.

## Main methods
I followed the methods described on the following websites:
```

```

## Results


## Findings
The articles in the subfields of “astrophysics” and “high energy physics” have higher chance to be correctly classified (∼35% higher f1-score than average). Maybe because they include more distinct terms compared to the other subfields.
